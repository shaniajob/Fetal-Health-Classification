# Fetal-Health-Classification

 This is an analytics project which classifies fetal health in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The first classification model was built using KNN, Decision tree and Random forest algorithms whose hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV.  The second model implements the same algorithms but on the best features of the dataset found using mutual information and applies SMOTE analysis to balance the dataset. Random Forest which was hypertuned gave the best results with an F1-score of 95.30%.
